# Why ?

I wrote this template in 2019 because I wanted to migrate a mediawiki-powered wiki to jekyll.

The template has a layout and a navigation that can replace my old wiki.

# How to

If you want to use this template, clone the [repository](https://github.com/jek4wik/jek4wik), customize it and write _wiki_ pages.

## Settings

The general settings are in the _config.yml file.

You may choose the *language*.
English (en) and french (fr) are supported out-of-the box.

```yaml
lang: en
```

You may customize the *collections*.
The only contraint is that the name of collections containing wiki pages should start with wiki.

```yaml
collections:
  wiki-one:
    output: true
    permalink: "/:path" 
    path: ""
  wiki-two:
    output: true
    permalink: "/:path"
    path: ""
  special:
    output: true
    permalink: "/:path"
    path: ""
```

Of course, you'll have to change the other site settings like title, description or url.

## i18n

The labels are in i18n files in the `_data/i18n` directory.

These files contain also prefixes for special pages, the name of home page and the logo that will be displayed on the top left.

```yaml
home: Main
logo: /img/wiki.png
label:
  author: Author
  links: Links
  tags: Other pages
  ...
prefix:
  tag: "Category:"
  user: "User:"
```

## Users

The users are declared in the _data/users.yml file.

```yaml
Alexis:
  name: Alexis Hassler
  logo: img/sewatech.png
```

Each user should have its page in the `_special` directory.
The name of this page starts with the prefix defined in the i18n file (here `User:`) 
and end with the user short name (here `Alexis`).

# Wiki pages

Wiki pages are in collections that name starts with wiki.
The bootstrap project provides 2 collections : `wiki` and `wiki-legacy`.

The pages can be written in HTML, Markdown or Asciidoc.

> Note: Asciidoc is not supported on Github pages.

## Regular wiki page

A regular wiki page should be place in a _wiki_ collection.
The only required metadata in frontmatter is the layout.
The simplest page may be something like this:

```yaml
---
layout: wiki
---
Example with minimal frontmatter
```

The frontmatter may contain the following attributes:

* title: will be displayed on top of the page
* author: will be displayed in a div in the left columns
* toc: true/false wether you want a generated table of content
* created and modified: date in format yyyy-MM-dd
* revisions: not displayed (maybe for a future use)

> Note: the toc plugin doesn't work on Github pages

## Redirect page

A redirect page should be place in the _special_ collection.
It should have a frontmatter with a **layout** and a **redirect**, and no content

```yaml
---
layout: redirect
redirect: New
---
```

> Note: redirections may be managed in an other way with the _jekyll-redirect-from_ plugin

## Tag page

A tag page should be place in a _special_ collection.
The file name should have the prefix defined in the _i18n_ file and end with the tag name.

For example, a file named `Tag:Example.md` would fit with the following i18n configuration.

```yaml
prefix:
  tag: "Tag:"
```

> Note: this is in the i18n files because mediawiki translates this prefix ; it is Category in english and CatÃ©gorie in french

The tag page may have the same metadata as a regular page.

```yaml
---
layout: tag
title: Example of Tag
tags: Example
toc: false

## Example Tag

Nice examples
```

## User pages

A user page should be place in a _special_ collection.
The file name should have the prefix defined in the _i18n_ file and end with the user name.

For example, a file named `User:Example.md` would fit with the following i18n configuration.

```yaml
prefix:
  user: "User:"
```

> Note: this is in the i18n files because mediawiki translates this prefix ; it is User in english and Utilisateur in french

The user page may have the same metadata as a regular page.

```yaml
---
layout: user
title: Alexis

# Deploy

The simplest way to deploy your wiki is to generate the site and copy it to a Web Server.

```yaml
jekyll build
```

As any Jekyll web site, the generation may be done on a CI server (TravisCI,...) or with the CI capabilities of the Git server (Gitlab, Github actions,...).

## Apache HTTP server

A `.htaccess` file is provided.
If the site is deployed on a Apache HTTP server, some old mediawiki URLs are rewritten to the new Jekyll URLs.

## Github pages

The wiki cannot be deloyed simply on Github pages because of unsupported filters and custom plugins.

If you want to deploy it on Github pages, you should push the generated site.
Any CI tool can help.

## Gitlab pages / CI

If your source code is hosted on Gitlab, you can deploy the wiki on Gitlab page.
The .gitlab-ci.yml provides a generic setup for that.
When you push on Gitlab, the file is be detected and a pipeline is run.
The wiki is then deployed on pages.

> Note: the deployment may occur several minutes after the end of the build.

With the provided configuration, Gitlab CI may also upload the site with SFTP.

Reference:

* [GitLab Pages](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/pages/)


## Github actions

[TBD]

## TravisCI

[Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) can launch automatically the jekyll build and deploy the site.

The examples and this page are built this way.
The [repository](https://github.com/jek4wik/jek4wik) provides a `.travis.yml` configuration file wich deploy the built site on Github Pages.
If want to use it, just change the `repo` and setup your build on Travis CI with the GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable.

With the provided configuration, Travis CI may also upload the site with SFTP.
