EncycloFusion is a Wiki providing information about [Clickteam](/clickteam).
The project aims to cover their [products](/clickteam/history), [exporters](/exporters), [extensions](/extensions),
and even more with in-depth information. Our aim with the Wiki is to provide **fully documented pages**
that make finding **answers simple to find**. We strike for **detail** to enable you to
**discover more possibilities** for Fusion and your projects.

EncycloFusion was forked from ClickWiki due to ClickWiki being archived, despite still being unfinished and containing some inaccurate information.
We aim to fix that.

The Wiki acts as a bridge between the help documentation, centralising tips & tricks
and frequently asked solutions buried in the [Community Forums].

### Predecessors
During 2010-2012, there was an official encyclopedia for Clickteam named **FusionWiki**.
However, due to an unforeseen update failure, the Wiki was taken offline permanently
and had lost **all** of its content.

From 2015-2023, an unofficial encyclopedia for Clickteam existed named ClickWiki.
On July 2023, the Wiki was archived due to not receiving any major updates in a while.
ClickWiki was left unfinished and with a handful of misinformation on it, so TropicalBananas forked ClickWiki, with an aim of continuing what was left unfinished.

This Wiki isn't the first to create and write up about Clickteam's products and features.
Other Wikis do exist but may be in other languages, for specific communities or for different purposes.
