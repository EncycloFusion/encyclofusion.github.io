With the exception of [Jamagic](/jamagic/)â€Ž, the Raycaster Object, and Firefly (3D for Fusion), Clickteam's products target 2D animation and creation. This page is dedicated to listing the possibilities of going beyond 2-dimension by simulating a 3D environment or using advanced graphical extensions.

Technique / Method | Difficulty | Description | External Resources
------------------ | ---------- | ----------- | ---------------------------
![]() [Isometric](/3D/isometric/) | Quite Easy | This is a form of 2D that simulates the 3D perspective. |
![]() [Perspective](/3D/perspective/) | Quite Easy | Allows you to transform a 2D image into a 3D room illusion. | [Sparckman's 3D Room](http://community.clickteam.com/threads/91230-3D-room-without-3D-software-five-nights-at-a-creepy-room)
![]() [Raycasting](/3D/raycasting/) | Fairly Easy | A paid extension called the Raycaster Object allows you to render a 3D environment from a 2D map. By Clickteam. | [On ClickStore](http://clickstore.clickteam.com/raycaster-object)
![]() [Firefly](/3D/firefly/) | Medium | A brand new set of objects to power CF2.5 with the ability to leverage the event editor to build your own 3D games and apps. By Clickteam. | * [On ClickStore](http://clickstore.clickteam.com/firefly3D)  * [On Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/app/267655/Firefly/) * [Tutorials](http://library.clickteam.com/firefly/firefly-tutorials/)
![OpenGL Logo](/wiki/assets/Platforms/OpenGL.png) [OpenGL](/3D/opengl/) | Difficult | Render actual 3D images within Fusion using OpenGL. These extensions are not actively being worked on, and can be considered outdated. | [3D Extension List](/extensions/3D/)

### Frameworks

The following are 3D engines programmed within Fusion.

##### P3D

* **Runtime:** Windows
