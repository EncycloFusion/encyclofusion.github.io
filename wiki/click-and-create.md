**Corel Click & Create**, shortened to **CNC** and also known
as **IMSI Multimedia Fusion Express** depending on the version is the successor to [Klik & Play]
developed by [Clickteam] and published by Corel. This product had a more professional
target demographic in mind with more tools, a more lenient runtime agreement and a steep price
of 695 USD.

Click & Create had a focus on Multimedia rather than just games, referring to
the user's creations as "applications" instead and saving them as CCA files.

The license for the software was eventually given to IMSI, who rebranded it as
**IMSI Multimedia Fusion Express**.
