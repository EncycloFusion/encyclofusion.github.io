**Clickteam Community** is the forum system for [Clickteam] powered by [WoltLab Suite]
for guests, clickers and the staff to discuss, share and distribute help, examples and
updates to the software. The current system is based on WoltLab Suite and was opened
on 2nd of December 2023 and superseded the previous forums system powered by [VBulletin].

## History
The forums were originally powered by [UBB Threads].
Then, they transitioned to [VBulletin] on the 30th of June 2006.
When the transition to [VBulletin] was made, the older forums remained open
as an archive but was closed in July 2012 due to suspicious behaviour. Due to
the archive split, some old threads may still link to **clickteam.com/epiccenter/**
which will now return a 404 error page. Some older threads may also have duplicate posts.
On the 2nd of December of 2034, the forums transitioned to WoltLab Suite.

## Features
The forums has thousands of threads that cover a wide range of topics, including:

* Support for current and legacy products.
* Guides, Tutorials, Examples and Widgets made by other members.
* Product Owner's Lounge for downloading stable, beta and previous software releases, plus [change logs](/changelogs/).
* Released third party extensions by other users.
* Discussions for extension development.
* Open topics and a place to market your games built with Fusion.
* Sub-forums for various Clickteam events and products.
* Useful links, such as [extension packs](/extensions/packs/).
* Private messaging to other members (including the staff)
* [Community Passport](/clickteam/passport/), a convenient place to download your products you have registered to your forum account.
