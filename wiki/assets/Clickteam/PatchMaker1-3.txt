Welcome to Patch Maker.


UNREGISTERED VERSION
--------------------
The Unregistered version of Patch Maker is freeware. You can
freely distribute the install programs you create with this version,
provided that you do not modify or remove the screen at the end of
the install programs.

The Unregistered version has all the features of the Registered version.


REGISTERED VERSION
------------------
The update patch programs created with the Registered version have no end screen.

To register, just connect to http://www.clickteam.com and purchase a license
fee. You will receive a registration code that will unlock the installation
of the registered version of Patch Maker.


WHAT'S NEW IN THIS VERSION
--------------------------

* A new "Icon file" option in the Options tab allows you to change the icon of the update program.
  Note: this feature doesn't work on Windows 9x.

* When the update patchs have to remove files, these files are now removed before other
  files are installed so that less free space is required on the destination drive.

* The program no longer requires administrator rights on Windows Vista / Seven.

* The old UI library has been modified to fix the problem with the buttons in the main window.


WHAT'S NEW IN PREVIOUS VERSIONS
-------------------------------

* New "Vista : Run as administrator" option. If this option is selected, the installer
  will be executed on Vista with elevated privileges. Note: this option should be selected
  for 99% of the installers, as it is required if, for example, you install files to a
  sub-directory of the Program Files directory. Unselect this option only if you know what you do.

* Zones to exclude now ignored if out of range.

* List of zones to exclude refreshed when you select the Advanced Options tab.

* Better compression with certain files in "Smallest" mode.

* Double-quote characters are removed from the beginning of the directory name loaded from the registry or INI files.

* NEW: option Smallest / Fastest in the Build page. The previous versions
of Patch Maker use the Fastest option. The Smallest option allows to
reduce the size of your patch program in certain cases, especially with
big files.

* NEW: when files are in use by other applications, the patch program
prompts the user to reboot Windows.

* FIX: wrong directory created when installing .DLL files to the system 
directory.

* FIX: crash with NT 4.0 on a few video cards in full window mode.

* FIX: "CRC error" when using "excluded zones" with high offsets.

* FIX: "unknown version" error message incorrectly displayed when there
are 2 identical files in several old versions.

* FIX: no more "Out of memory" message when making a patch for a very big file.

* NEW: new option "If unknown version / Install it" in the File Options tab.


KNOWN PROBLEMS
--------------

* Patch Maker is not very efficient with some big files that are very different. 
This version of Patch Maker is much more efficient than the previous versions with
this kind of files, but is still not perfect and in some cases can give a result 
only equal to a normal zip compression.
