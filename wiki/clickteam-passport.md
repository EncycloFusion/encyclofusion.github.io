The **Community Passport** is a feature of the [forums](/clickteam/community) that allows users to register
their products to their forum account. Registration is optional, but doing so will
allow you to easily download newer versions of the software, betas and access links
specific to that product. You also receive a badge so other users know which products you own.
Steam users can also add/update their Steam ID so their products show up too.

## Registration
Previously, product registration was performed in the [Settings](http://community.clickteam.com/usercp.php)
page of the forums, but the introduction of the Community Passport allowed for convenience
for links, badges and other resources.

Only one serial can be assigned to any one forum account at any time. Serials can
be found on receipts, e-mails or on the [Clickteam Shop](/clickteam/shop/)'s order history.

Once registered, serials cannot be unassigned or transferred without [contacting Clickteam](http://www.clickteam.com/contact-us).

### Purchased on Steam
Clickteam products that are purchased through Steam can only receive badges, due to the fact stand-alone versions cannot be installed to Steam versions. There is a section that allows you to add/update your Steam ID, and the forum will retrieve the products you have purchased in Steam's ecosystem.

## Features
The **Community Passport** is mainly beneficial for stand-alone products, due to
technical differences with the Steam version. The service allows you to:

* Download installers for products and [exporters] you have purchased.
* Download beta versions of products and [exporters].
* Be provided with links related to a product/[exporters].
* Product [SDK]
* Product Owner Lounge sub-forums
* Links to upgrade to new versions (as of June 2015, coming soon)
