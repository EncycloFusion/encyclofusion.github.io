The iOS Exporter is an exporter that allows you to export to Apple iOS Devices, including iPhones, iPods, and iPads. You will also need a [Mac](https://apple.com/mac) running Xcode and a [Registration in an Apple Developer Program](https://developer.apple.com/programs). (You can test on your own device for free with Xcode 7 and up.)

# Build Types

## iOS Xcode Project
iOS Xcode Project is the build type you should use on your first build.

* This will generate a ZIP file containing multiple files and folders, including a CCI file and an XCODEPROJ file.
* Transfer the ZIP file to your Mac (using a Removable storage device, Online storage, or Home Server) and unzip the file by double-clicking it.
* Open the XCODEPROJ file. (You will need Xcode installed. [Download](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads)).

## iOS Application (.cci)
iOS Application is the build type you should use when you update your game.

* This will generate a CCI file.
* You must name it Application.cci , or else it will not work.
* Transfer the file to your Mac.
* Drag it into the folder that used to be the ZIP file that was previously created.
* If it asks if you want to replace the file Application.cci , click Yes.
* Open the XCODEPROJ file again. It should be updated.

## iOS Final Xcode project
When you are ready to publish your project, select the build type iOS Final Xcode Project.

* Follow the same steps as iOS Xcode Project.
* Build the file in Xcode.

# Requirements
* [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode) ([Download](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads)) is needed to simulate/test/publish your application.
* You will need a [Mac](https://www.apple.com/mac) to run Xcode.
