By default, Fusion uses the resolution of **640x480** for new projects. This page will detail suggested ways to pick one that's right for your project.

## Standard Sizes
Here's a table of resolutions commonly used for applications and games.

#### Desktop

{:.table .table-hover .table-sm}
Standard | Screen Resolution(s) | Aspect Ratio | Commonly known as
-------- | -------------------- | ------------ | -------------------
VGA | 640x480 | 4:3 |
Super VGA | 800x600 | 4:3 |
XGA | 1024x768 | 4:3 |
XGA+ | 1152x864 | 4:3 |
XGA+ | 1152x870 | 4:3 |
XGA+ | 1152x900 | 4:3 |
High Definition | 1360x768 | 16:9 | 720p
High Definition | 1366x768 | 16:9 | 720p
WXGA | 1280x800 | 16:10 |
SXGA | 1280x1024 | 5:4 |
SXGA+ | 1440x900 | 16:10 |
High Definition | 1600x900 | 16:9 | 900p
UXGA | 1600x1200 | 4:3 |

High Definition | 1920x1080 | 16:9 | 1080p
WUXGA | 1920x1200 | 16:10 |
Full HD Plus | 1920x1280 | 3:2 |
Quad HD | 2048x1080 | 16:9 | 1440p / 2K
Ultra HD | 3840x2160 | 16:9 | 2160p / 4K

**If your project is designed for a TV screen:**

{:.table .table-hover .table-sm}
Standard    | Resolution    | Known as  |
----------- | ------------- | --------- |
480p | 720x480 | Enhanced-definition (EDTV)
576p | 720x576 | Enhanced-definition (EDTV)
720p | 1280x720 | High-definition (HDTV)
1080p | 1920x1080 | High-definition (HDTV)
1440p "2K" | 2560x1440 | Ultra-high-definition (UHDTV)
2160p "4K" | 3840x2160 | Ultra-high-definition (UHDTV)
4320p "8K" | 7680x4320 | Ultra-high-definition (UHDTV)

Note that the higher the resolution, the more processing power is required by Fusion and consequently, your machine.

#### Android

There are billions of Android devices out there, it is important to design your [Fusion](/fusion/) project that looks good on all types of screen sizes and densities.

**Screen Size**

> The device's physical size, measured as a diagonal. Android groups these sizes into four generalized sizes: **small**, **normal**, **large** and **extra-large**.

**Screen Density**

> The quantity of pixels on the device's physical screen. Referred to as **DPI** (dots per inch). Android groups them into: low, medium, high, xhigh, xxhigh and xxxhigh.

Due to this, there isn't an easy answer to which resolution to use, as it depends on the type of game. [There is a discussion thread here.](http://community.clickteam.com/threads/89295-what-resolution-to-use-while-developing-for-android)
