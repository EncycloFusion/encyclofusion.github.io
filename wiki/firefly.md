**Firefly** is a set of 3D extensions for [Clickteam Fusion 2.5]
developed by [Clickteam]. These extensions allow you to use a 3D engine within [Clickteam Fusion 2.5]

Firefly is based on a modified version of the [Irrlicht Engine](https://irrlicht.sourceforge.io/), It is composed of objects
called [Nodes that interact with the Firefly engine.](/extensions/firefly/)

Firefly has a bit of a learning curve, so taking a look at some [documentation, tutorials and examples](/firefly/learning)
is recommended.
