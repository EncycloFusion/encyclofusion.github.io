**Multimedia Fusion 2**, or as commonly referred to as **MMF2** is a visual programming
tool by [Clickteam] to allow the creation of applications and games.
It is the successor to [Multimedia Fusion 1.5] but is now preceded by [Clickteam Fusion 2.5].
There are 3 editions of the software, each sharing the same interface, but offer different
features, additional [exporters](/exporters/), and [runtime agreements](/runtime-agreement/).

As an addition to these editions, there was also a [Newgrounds Edition](/games-factory-2/#Newsground_Edition) and a demo version.

## Editions

#### Developer

This is the ultimate, royalty free, creditability free edition of the program.
It allows the use of developer only extensions, as well as no need to credit
[Clickteam], use a Fusion logo or state that it was created with Fusion.
Users who purchased this product see the dark blue logo.

#### Standard
This still features the same interface from the Developer edition, but is much more
affordable and doesn't work with Developer only extensions and requires the user
to credit [Clickteam] with a "[Made with Fusion Logo](/made-with-fusion/logo/)" somewhere in their product.
Users who purchase this product will see a light cyan logo.

This was originally available to download from Clickteam's website to test the software.
It was very limited in functionality featuring 30 days before expiring, no extensions
and could not export creations. Towards the end of Multimedia Fusion's lifespan, the
trial had been updated to give potential users a test drive for all 3 products,
including exporters. This did not change the fact a trial user cannot export creations,
and can not save [MFA] files after 30 days. Users can open a specific product
(Example: Multimedia Fusion 2 Developer) directly or open the Demo app to select exporters.



## Interface
The editor is split up into various interfaces, used in order to modify different
aspects of applications or games.

* [Storyboard Editor](/interface/storyboard-editor/) - For modifying frames and their fade transitions.
* [Frame Editor](/interface/frame-editor/) - For modifying the objects, extensions, and appearance of a frame.
* [Event Editor](/interface/event-editor/) - For defining the logic of the program, through actions, conditions, and events.
* [Toolbars](/interface/toolbars/) - A customizable dockable interface throughout the program.
* [Data Elements](/interface/data-elements/) - For modifying samples, binary data and external files used in an application.

**Standard/Developer Only:**

* [Event List Editor](/interface/event-list-editor/) - An expanded view to see conditions and actions.

## Exporters
An exporter enables a user to build an application or game to a different platform.
These can be optionally purchased and allow developing for more platforms.
Extensions may be incompatible and/or behave differently with exporters due to code
differences, so it is essential to [check the compatibility](/extensions/) between them first.

* [Windows](/exporters/Windows/) (default)
* [Java](/exporters/Java/) (included)
* [Vitalize](/exporters/Vitalize/) (included)
* [Flash](/exporters/Flash/)
* [Android](/exporters/Android/)
* [iOS](/exporters/iOS/)
* [XNA](/exporters/XNA/)
* **[Compare Exporters](/exporters/compare/)**

**There are no longer updates to this product, but it is still supported.**

## Comparison
Different features are available depending on which edition the user purchases.
[The Games Factory 2] can be seen as a budget version of the Standard edition,
whilst the Developer edition is a more advanced and royalty, logo and credit free
version of the Standard edition.
