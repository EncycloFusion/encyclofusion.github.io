The Storyboard editor is where you edit the frames of your application. It shows the frames in the order you have created them.  
The editor allows you to resize them, change the order, size. password and fades.  
The properties for the frame can be found in the properties but some people prefer to use the Storyboard editor for the synthetic view it provides.
