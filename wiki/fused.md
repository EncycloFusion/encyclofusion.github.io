**Fused** was an official [Clickteam] blog edited by [Danny] from Clickteam. This news is designed to provide in-sight behind the scenes at Clickteam and around the community, featuring news for [Fusion 2.5] and [Fusion 3] in addition to game reviews and guides. The blog format was adopted [to provide quicker and more frequent updates](https://www.facebook.com/clickteam/posts/10153543937356356).

Originally, Fused! was a monthly PDF e-magazine started in October 2014 targeted for release on the 9th or 10th of each month, however the PDF format has since been dropped.

At some point, the Fused blog was taken down. However, the blog is archived in the Wayback Machine.

## Previous Releases
There is currently no "official" location for acquiring copies of the e-magazine. New issues are announced on the forums, the mailing list and the Fused! Facebook page.

However, a list has been gathered on the Wiki:

{% include alert
  type = "info"
  title = "Inaccessible over HTTPS"
  message = "When accessed over HTTPS, the PDF URLs redirect to a 404 page, so if you use HTTPS Everywhere, make sure you disable \"Encrypt All Sites Eligible\"."
%}

{% include magazine-listing %}

After these issues, the e-magazine format was adopted to become a [a blog instead](https://web.archive.org/web/20190416204744/http://www.clickteamfused.com/).
