**The Games Factory**, or shortened to **TGF** is the successor product to [Klik & Play]
developed by Europress (now known as Clickteam). It was a sister product to
[Click & Create] at release, which offered additional features and had a more
relaxed runtime agreement. The product's distribution varied by region.
For instance, in the United Kingdom, it was published by [Empire Interactive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_Interactive)
under the publishing label [Xplosiv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_Interactive#Xplosiv) (now defunct)

The software was released in 1996 and is available in 2 editions: Home and Pro.
It also provided an option to install the 16-bit version (for Windows 3.1 users)
or the 32-bit version (for Windows 95 users). Creations saved by the product used
the [GAM] file extension as well as being able to create stand alone executables
with an optional installer. An unregistered "trial" version was also available.

## Editions

#### Home
This is the low-cost version of the product released in 1996 which allowed the
user to make games without needing to learn code. The distribution agreement
is that games created by the software will display a compulsory splash screen
advertising the product. Additionally, the software states the software should
be distributed at no cost as freeware and should contact Europress if they were
charged for the stand alone program.

#### Unregistered
The installer also lets you install the unregistered 30-day free trial of the Home version.

#### Pro
The Pro edition removes the splash screen at the end of stand alone games,
permits the user to sell their creations, and has a Time Line editor.
This was available to obtain via [Clickteam](/clickteam), but with the release of [Multimedia Fusion 2],
this is no longer possible. Users wanting to upgrade are advised to update to a newer
version of the product. TGF Pro is the same as **Multimedia Fusion Express**, previously
[Click & Create].
