Clickteam's **Bug Tracker** (also known as the bugbox) is a place for registered
users to report bugs, provide feedback and make suggestions for new features.
This is the primary place to go to when you notice a problem with a variety of
Clickteam's products and services.

As of 25th February 2019, the BugBox was taken offline for good.
