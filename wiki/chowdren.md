**Chowdren** is a C++ runtime for exported Fusion applications and games. The runtime recompiles and optimizes events to C++, allowing it to run on **Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, Wii U, 3DS, PS4 and PS Vita**, with PS3 and Xbox One being considered. Fusion's regular runtime emulates events, hence Chowdren offers an extremely significant increase in performance. Chowdren also performs additional tasks (such as sprite merging) to ensure the final executable is as small as possible.

The project was **open source** under the GPL. Executables generated by Chowdren **requires distribution** of the source code as well. If you do not want to distribute the source code, a **commercial license is available** by contacting [Mathias](http://community.clickteam.com/members/5234-Mathias).

In March 2016, the repository was made private which means no more updates will be released under the GPL. It was previously possible to [download the GPL version](http://mp2.dk/chowdren/cmdtool.zip) and the [CCN Export plugin](http://mp2.dk/chowdren/setup.exe) (build 284 and up) from the [Chowdren website](http://mp2.dk/chowdren/). The commercial license and porting service is still available.

## Benchmarks

According to [Mathias](http://community.clickteam.com/members/5234-Mathias), the runtime is on average **7.7x faster** when against the regular Windows Runtime.

[A community member has also performed some benchmarks, which also shows a tremendous increase in performance.](http://community.clickteam.com/threads/74080-Chowdren-Blazingly-fast-Fusion-exporter-for-desktop-amp-consoles?p=647615&viewfull=1#post647615)

## Compatibility

As with any [exporter](/exporters/), not all extensions or events are compatible with Chowdren. However, as the code is written in Python, if the event or extension is implemented, it will work on all platforms Chowdren supports.

Chowdren also has an exporter plugin for build 284 and up. This will make it convenient for users to export to particular platforms from within Fusion, as the runtime currently is external and does not hide extensions or actions that are not implemented.

[See the Chowdren Compatiblity page](/chowdren/compatibility/) for a full list of extensions, objects, actions.
