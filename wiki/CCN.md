**CCN** (Compressed Multimedia Fusion File) is the file format used by sub-applications, [Vitalize] applications and within
Android applications made in Fusion. It is supported by [Click & Create], [The Games Factory], [Multimedia Fusion],
[Multimedia Fusion 2], [The Games Factory 2] and [Clickteam Fusion 2.5].

Most .CCN files cannot be opened directly in [Fusion]'s editor, but can be integrated into applications through sub-applications.
Most of them can also be opened by the [Vitalize] ActiveX control.
