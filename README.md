# EncycloFusion
A new unofficial Clickteam wiki forked from [ClickWiki](https://github.com/ClickWiki/clickwiki.github.io), made with the aim of superseding and adding more information to [ClickWiki](https://github.com/ClickWiki/clickwiki.github.io).
We aim to update the information about both new and old Clickteam with more accuracy.
